      Lobby Server
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The Lobby Server is a plugin that provides PostgreSQL database-driven
        functionality for persistent game data and matchmaking. The Lobby
        Server itself does not require significant user interaction - instead,
        commands are carried out via the LobbyClient_PC class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lobby Server is split into two classes. LobbyServer itself solely
        provides networking functionality, calling interfaces to a generic
        database via virtual functions. LobbyServerPostgreSQL, found at
        DependentExtensions\Lobby\LobbyServer_PostgreSQL\LobbyServer_PostgreSQL.h,
        is an implementation of LobbyServer that uses PostgreSQL to power the
        database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic class has functions to connect to the database and create
        and destroy the basic required tables. The sample found at
        Samples/LobbyServerTest/LobbyServerTest.cpp, in the project
        LobbyServer, demonstrates this fairly clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        One additional requirement is the use of the Functor class. A functor
        is a class in RakNet that implements a specific unit of functionality
        that is run asynchronously in a FunctionThread, another utility class
        that is part of RakNet. For the most part, you don't have to care
        about this - however, there is one functor you do have to care about,
        which is the one to add new titles (games/applications) to the
        database.
      </p>
      <p>
        How to do this is illustrated in the sample: <br>
        <span class="text-bold">AddTitle_PostgreSQLImpl *functor =
          AddTitle_PostgreSQLImpl::Alloc();</span><br>
        <span class="text-bold">...</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This adds a title to the database with various properties indicating
        what types of operations are allowed for this title. See the class
        declaration AddTitle_Data in
        DependentExtensions\Lobby\TitleValidationDBSpec.h for a complete
        explanation of each parameter. Many other functors are available to
        perform various database operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        See LobbyServerTest for a console application that will run the
        LobbyServer.

        PostgreSQL 8.2 or newer, installed at C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.2.
        Change the project property paths should your installation directory
        be different. Do not forget to check development tools in the
        PostgreSQL installer or the headers and libs will not be installed.

        User interface to the database
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Quick start:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Attach the plugin to an instance of RakPeerInterface and connect
          to the server.</li>
        <li>Call SetCallbackInterface() with a derived implementation of
          LobbyClientInterfaceCB. The general design of the system is that all
          calls are asynchronous, so each call will return its results
          (success or failure) to your registered callback.</li>
        <li>If you do not already have an account, call RegisterAccount to
          create a user account on the lobby. Wait for
          LobbyClientInterfaceCB::RegisterAccount_Result() to see if the query
          was successful. One possible failure is that the name is already in
          use or disallowed (swear word).</li>
        <li>Call SetTitleLoginId() with information identifying what title you
          are playing (can be done later if multiple games are allowed per
          lobby). This should have been hardcoded into the application,
          returned when the title was added to the server (as documented
          above).</li>
        <li>Call Login() with the account you just created (or previously had
          stored). Wait for LobbyClientInterfaceCB::Login_Result() to indicate
          success. If you have friends, they should get
          LobbyClientInterfaceCB::FriendStatus_Notify() calls that you are
          online.</li>
        <li>Use DownloadRooms() to get a list of all rooms, based on search
          filters, followed by JoinRoom(), SetReadyToPlayStatus(), and
          StartGame(). Or use QuickMatch() to automatically start a game with
          a given number of players.</li>
        <li>Once the game starts, you will get
          LobbyClientInterfaceCB::StartGame_Notify(). This will give you the
          IP addresses of all players, participants, who the moderator is,
          user handles, and other information relevant to playing the game. At
          this point, you can disconnect from the lobby. If you do not, you
          are automatically sent back to the main lobby (outside of any room).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For a complete list of functions, with documented parameters, see
        DependentExtensions\Lobby\LobbyClientPC.h.

          use the default console application as a framework to base your own
          GUI implementation on.</li>
